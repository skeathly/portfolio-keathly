                    Developed an internal auditing application for RSM which included multiple subsidiary applications 
                    developed in React.  Application made use of React Hooks rather than older style class components.
                </li>
                <li>Integrated project into modules to help keep several distinct applications organized.</li>

                <li>
                    Utilized React-Bootstrap framework to help speed up development time and customized it using 
                    SASS to align with RSM branding guidelines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Made use of React's Context API to handle state management application needs and also used 
                    Jest for testing.
